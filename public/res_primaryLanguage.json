      "description": "Welcome to my personal website. To tell you a little about this page, I created this with the thought that this would only be a portfolio :). But then I realized, resume and github can do all of that, and so this page should be something more and show myself under different lights. It will. But for the intial release, it will be a pretty webpage for my techie side. I love coding and working the niche software, but I also like art, drawing, designing, and doing crafts. These are all the things that make me who I am and  to show people I'm working with newest front-end and back-end frameworks and enjoy doing crafts in my free time. What you are seeing now is my portfolio template in use, which inspired by Dorota1997's template. I want the website to represent me with all the cool effects so I went and rewrote a lot of the part with the If you like this portfolio template, make sure to ‚≠ê the repository to make it more recognizable for other users. Thank you üíú",

Crypto was surely in the limelight, so I checked it out, and the best way to understand it was to use it in something. I came across this tutorial on the internet and dived in the process of making this web app. It was something that prelimary but fundalmental enought for me not to just learn about blockchain, but also web application as well. I learned alot about server, endpoints, and all the html things from this experience. Since this was course extension for my honor experience in a class, the professor wanted to have somekind of documentation on it",
