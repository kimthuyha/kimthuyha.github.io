          <h3>Welcome to my personal website. I first created this page because I want to learn React,  
            but then I got ambitious and want something more. Tech is a huge part of me, but also are art and crafts, 
            and I want this page to reflect that dynamics.  For now, it might not be there yet, but it WILL. 
          </h3>
          <h3>
          I like design and play with the front end frameworks to make pretty pages, but for some reasons,
          I've spent majority of the time doing the backend work, which I also love. That's why this page is a way
          for me to fill in the gaps that are missing for me to become a full-stack developer üìΩÔ∏è. 
          </h3>
          <h3>
          What you are seeing now is my portfolio template in use (<a>link</a>),
          which is inspired by Dorota1997's template. I want the website to represent me 
          so I rewrote a lot of the parts and added a lot of me factors. If you like this template, 
          follow the link I mentioned or in the project section and star ‚≠ê the repository 
          to make it more recognizable for other users.
