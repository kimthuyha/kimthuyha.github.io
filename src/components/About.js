            You can find below the list of applicaitions that I have worked on along with some experience that

          To introduce a little bit about myself, I am a recent CS grad and going to work at a tech company upon my gradution.
          I have mostly worked on back-end projects but am also interested in front-end development ü§ì.
          </h3>
          <h3>
          Other than tech, crafts and movie are also big parts of my life. I really hope that I can share those with you here
          in the future üìΩÔ∏è.

          What you are seeing now is my portfolio template in use (<a>link</a>),
          which used Dorota1997's template as the base, and with a lot of modification, I tried to customize it
          to make sure the page represents me.
